                                Explaining Backrooms Level 227, the 228th level of the Backrooms, is very complex and aquires a way too many words. It is a tiny little room with no doors and one window, as well as some dasks and chairs like those found in education centers. Thats it. This is evrything a visitor can find in this level. Warn Broogli he needs to update his list of the five smallest levels! An entire world can be seen at the other side of the window found here, one that has people walking around and talking about dayly stuff, one that simingly changes dayly, being the hall of a school some days, a plaza others, a city street sometimes... None of them is execible though, as breaking the window or atempting to no-clip trough it sends to <a href="https://backrooms-freewriting.fandom.com/wiki/You_Cheated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">level You Cheated!</a>.

                                Parhaps, the most dengerus thing about level 227 is the feeling of seeing such happy enviroments from a translucent barrier and being unable to aceces them its worlds projector window poses, as it might lead to sadness and lonlyness. This feeling has been comparated to being sick during a weekend and unable to leave home, waching friends play happly outside.
